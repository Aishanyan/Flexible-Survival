The voice yells, though its cry is slightly distorted as it echoes off the cold stone walls. 'Hey, if someone's out there, I could really use some help! The floor collapsed out from under me, I'm trapped, and can't feel my legs! Please, if someone's out there [bold type]HELP![roman type]' they wail over an almost resigned pitiable whimper. 'I-I-I, don't want to die down here...' the not too far off voice sobs from the shadows. The sheer desperation of their cry tugs at your heart strings, and a part of you wonders if you should go search for them. A more rational, cynical side of you though cautions against getting involved. The sewers are home to some rather nasty creatures, this call, no matter how realistic it sounds, may be a trap.";

Your hurried footfalls echo throughout the humid corridors as the unseen person screams and hollers after you, begging you for aid. With each passing second, their voice cracks in desperation. They promise you gold, sex, their first born child, anything you want if you'll just save them, or at the very least send help. Though as it becomes ever more obvious you're moving away from them. The voice grows increasingly angry and unhinged, spouting death threats, curses, and all manner of obscenities that would shock an old salt, but your time in the city has made you numb to such obvious ploys.

As proficient a survivor as you may be though, it's easy to get yourself turned around in the oppressive gloom of the sewer tunnels as the resounds and through the interlinked web of passageways. More than once, you find yourself walking down deadends, or stopped by the odd decrepit tunnel in varying stages of collapse. Some are riddled with gnarled black roots and strange red fleshy vines likely originating from the otherworldly nanite-enhanced plants of urban forest or the swamp. Others show signs of water damage as pools of foul-smelling water cascade from deep umbral gouges in the ceiling and pools about the cracked floor as the city's failing utilities likely burst from the lack of maintenance, or result of the geological disturbance brought about by the destruction of the capitol district.";
			say "     Growing desperate, and a tad frustrated by the constant stream of setbacks, you call out to them, asking where they are, not caring who hears you at this point so long as you can locate this fellow survivor. 'I, um I'm not sure, I was following the purple line out towards the bay when the ground gave way,' the distorted voice yells from somewhere. Looking around you can't see anything that could be called a [']purple line['], just pipes, pipes, and more freaking pipes, than it hits you. The overhead utility lines are all painted different colors, likely to denote their contents. Poking around the area, you soon find one dyed a rich magenta. [if perception of player >= 20]Though something about them seems a bit... off, none of them have pipe clamps securing them to the ceiling, and a few even seem to have been woven around the older lines like a wet noodle. Guess the city was cheaping out on maintenance, you opine following the down towards what you hope is the bay[else if perception of player < 20]Oddly, unlike the rest of the pipe which are rather faded, coated in grim, or riddled with rust bubbles, the purple pipelines are all coated in pristine glittering dye as if someone just came by and painted them. Perhaps they were installed recently, you muse, following the branches down towards what you assume is the bay[end if]."; [Note: IRL a purple pipe denotes a line carrying dangerous or toxic chemicals in need of special treatment.]

Unbidden sweat and condensation drip down your face along with the nearby walls in warm copper-scented rivulets. It feels like you've walked into a monsoon jungle, or the mouth of a great decaying creature as the once still air coils and writhes about you. Which should be impossible this far underground, but you push aside such idle intrusive thoughts for the moment to concentrate on the task at hand. As you call out once more, letting the fellow survivor know you've found the line, and you're on your way. 'Oh thank Tiamat! You sound a lot closer now, just watch your step! The whole place has gotten really unstable recently,' the resounding echo of the survivor's voice hollers back in slightly relieved, though still somewhat rattled, tone. Nodding your head in acknowledgement, you voice your appreciation as you eye up some of the jagged cracks forming in the nearby walls with suspicion.";
			say "     You proceed at a measured pace keeping one eye on the ground and the other on the ceiling. As the pathway grows ever more decrepit, you have to duck and dive out of the way of a few falling bits of cement and old brick as the ground almost seems to shift and tremble in aggravation of your trespass. Each loud crash echoes throughout the sewer with a broken distorted knell almost as if you were underwater. Still, you push on and after rounding yet another twisting path in your strange circuit, you finally come upon the trapped survivor. She, at least you assume they are a she going by the presence of the pair of shapely c-cups covered up by a plain black t-shirt, is halfway buried up to their diaphragm in broken concrete. At first glance they at least appear to be mostly human (at least from the waist up) with deathly pale olive skin. Their face, despite being covered in sweat and grime, has classic almost ageless beauty like one would see on ancient Greek statues. While their ears resemble a set of blue aquatic fins with a pronounced reptile or draconic bend, and are framed by long black hair.";

Strewn all around them are dozens of empty water bottles, the remains of energy bar wrappers, alongside a sturdy looking hiking backpack. As your eyes meet, they wave you over exclaiming, 'Holy shit you're real! I haven't seen anyone in days, even the mutants seem to avoid this place. I thought,' they mumble in cadence boarding on mania as they shake their head in disbelief at the sight of you, 'I thought, I was starting to go crazy when I heard your voice.' Assuring them that you are very much real, you gingerly head over to get a better look at their predicament. You realize the poor person has definitely been here quite awhile if the mess wasn't enough of an indication. The area around them is covered in rusty red speckled scratch marks. Their fingertips likewise have all been ground to raw jagged bloody edges, and their arms are covered to the elbows in gray grime.";
			say "     The cement adjacent to them though is crushed to finely-ground moist gray sand. Almost like it had undergone a partial form of liquefaction then sealed itself perfectly around them like a glove. The more you look at it, it's a wonder they weren't crushed to death, or can even breathe based on how tight the material hugs their hourglass waist. You muse, grimacing at the thought. 'That bad eh?' the post-human asks, noticing the dour look on your face. Offering them a reassuring smile, you try to tell them not to worry as you consider your options. The obvious answer would be to try and pull them out. Your combined strength may just do the trick. Alternatively, you could try convincing the Wolverines at the Mall, or perhaps some of its residents to send down a rescue party to dig them out. If you're feeling particularly malicious, you could also just steal their bag and its contents. A good backpack would be quite useful given the state of the world, after all every pound of carry capacity counts. It's not like they can stop you anyways.";

Walking behind them, you squat down and hook your arms under theirs telling them on the count of three to push with all them might while you pull. 'Ok,' the monster person replies in a dubious tone, bracing their arms beside them. Right, one, two, THREE! You grunt and lift with all the strength your [BodyName of Player] legs can muster. The ground creaks and groans as the tightly packed rubble resists your efforts, though little by little, you feel it slowly giving way as tiny fissures form across the surface of the compacted gray substrate. Encouraged, you push yourself even harder, and feel the rubble finally give way, with an oddly wet organic pop like someone was cracking their knuckles, as the survivor slips loose.";
					say "     You both go stumbling backwards, landing in a pile a few yards away as the ground you were just standing on seems to knit shut. Equally stunned by the alien sight, the two of you stare slack jawed as the ground seamlessly repairs itself before your eyes. 'D-did you just see that too, or am I really starting to go mad?' the survivor asks, their voice overflowing with fear as they point accusingly to the spot where the hole just was. Nodding nervously you tell them yes, you did. 'Ok, fuck this place and the horse it rode in on, I'm getting the hell out of here!' They cry as they try to rise on bare shaky legs. Looking like a newborn calf trying to take its first steps, they barely even manage to stand up before collapsing in a spread eagle position on the ground with a hard thud. 'Shit my legs must still be asleep and,' they pause to take hold of and massage the shapely thighs of their right leg, 'what in the fucking hell happened to my fucking leather shorts! SHIT! GOD-FUCKING-DAMN IT, those were from Mr. S leather!'";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     She, you confirm, noting the plush lips of her slightly dripping pale-bronze pussy, which she makes no effort to cover as she cries, motioning to her sweaty unnaturally-pasty-looking limbs. Unsure what to say to her, and not wanting to stick around in this crazy place any longer, you grab her bag and offer her your hand. 'Thanks, you're a real lifesaver,' she grunts, pulling herself up to her full height of five foot six. She drapes her left arm over your shoulders for support. The pair of you swiftly shuffle off, though you both eye the spot where the pit was mere moments ago, rather banefully. Already the floor seems to have been completely repaired, almost like the large rent in the ground was never even there. While it's not the oddest thing you've seen in recent days, this is definitely going on the list you muse, trudging your way back to the mall. Along the way, the survivor appears to perk up a bit as the color gradually returns to her legs. She's soon able to walk on her own power, albeit somewhat slowly.";
					say "     Not wanting to tire them out, you decide to let them set the pace and try striking up a bit of small talk to pass the time. Minutes pass and you eventually learn her name is Galaxite, or at least she claims it is, and that she was apparently looking for a supposed group of survivors that have set up shop near one of the many ghost stations hidden under the city. If what she says is true, they allegedly have access to water and power but are said to be a tad isolationist. Curious about her plans, you ask what she was hoping to accomplish by finding them. 'Well, I was sort of hoping we could work out some kind of trade deal. I mean everyone needs utilities, right? I've seen huge brawls break out in the mall over who gets to use a half dead power brick. Can you imagine how much folks would pay just to charge their phones or laptops right now? I'd probably be set till help arrives if I could pull this off!' Galaxite proclaims, rather proudly and greedily at the thought. True enough, but why is she in the sewer if she's looking for a ghost station?";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     Shouldn't she be prowling the metro lines, not this god forsaken Shaft Beast and demon-infested hell hole, you reply. 'Right... well I probably shouldn't tell you this but-,'  Galaxite pauses to look around the tunnels. 'Most of the decommissioned stations are blocked off in one way or another to prevent homeless people from squatting in them, or to keep copper thieves out,' she adds, gesturing to some rubber insulated wires above you. 'The city still needs access from time to time, never know when a sump pump will break down, or a rat will chew through a power cable. From what I hear, a lot of these hidden accessways are in the sewers. If I find it, I should be able to climb right down to the ghost station. Well,' she shrugs with a bemused half smirk, 'that was the theory,' she adds as the two of you come in sight of the hole leading back up to the mall. Gazing at the lantern light spilling down from the world above, Galaxite pauses and turns to you saying in a bemused tone.";
					say "     'Hey, I know this may be a bit of an ask, but uh,' she hesitates rocking back and forth of her heels as she nervously eyes the exit, 'could you go on ahead and maybe find me a newspaper or something to cover up the goods? I don't feel comfortable walking around half naked this close to the Shag Shack. Wouldn't want the locals to get the wrong idea,' she jokes through a Cheshire smile, motioning to her lower half with a knowing flourish. Shrugging, you reply that's probably wise and hop ahead of her then root around the area for a bit. Thankfully, due to the lack of trash pickups the surrounding environment is littered with all sorts of random crap people abandoned when the pandemic started. It's not long to till you slightly less abused news rag laying about and pass it down to Galaxite. 'Thanks, you fucking rock!' she says, wrapping the moldering paper around herself like a towel and then pulls herself out. Once she's standing on Terra-firma and straightens out her shoddy covering, you follow after and go to offer her bag back, but stops you with a wave of her hand.";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     'No, you keep it, it's not much, but you're welcome to help yourself to my bag and what's left of the supplies. It's the least I can do, I've got some stuff squirreled away nearby,' she says, gesturing to the outskirts of the mall with a broad wave of her hand, 'so you don't have to worry about me. It's not my first time slumming it on the streets or anything.' Nodding, you express your gratitude and wish them well. Flashing a warm almost too-toothy smile Galaxite returns the sentiment and heads off to parts unknown, muttering something under her breath about meeting someone at [bold type]the beach[roman type]. Once she's departed, you take a moment to dig through the pack. Inside, you find a pair of sugary sports drinks with a black wolf head on the logo, some clean bandages still wrapped in a thin lucid sheet of plastic, alongside a beat up claw hammer, and a few energy bars. It's not your best haul, but at least you have something to show for your work. Who said good deeds don't go unrewarded?";

				-- "Get help.":
					say "     Recalling some apocryphal news stories about people stuck in similar circumstances, you reason that it would be best to try and enlist some support. For all you know, trying to pull them out or digging around them could just make things worse. At the moment, they and the surrounding area appear to be stable, it wouldn't do you or them any good if you somehow ended up getting trapped down here with them or worse; you end up crippling them trying to save them. Sighing in defeat, you tell them you're going to have to head back to the mall and get help. 'Wait what the fuck! You're gonna leave me here!?' they cry, eyes widening in alarm. Nodding in the affirmative, you regretfully reply that you don't have means to dig them out safely, so you're going to need some help. 'Well could you try pulling me out instead?' they beg, their voice cracking with desperation. Trying to put on a brave face, you explain that you have no idea what condition their lower body is in right now.";
					say "     For all you know, their bottom half could be completely pulped. The pressure of earth and their nanite healing factor might be the only thing holding them together. If you pull them out recklessly well... 'Oh god,' they sob, looking down at their trapped form as the realization of the true weight of their situation hits them. Kneeling down, you pat them on the shoulder, telling them not to panic. Someone will come for them soon, hopefully with the tools necessary to pull them out. 'You mean it?' they croak, wiping a soot-laced tear from their eyes. Smiling warmly, you tell them that you do, and head off towards the Mall at a breakneck pace. Thankfully, the way is just as barren as when you came the way, so you make good time. Once you catch sight of the hole to the bathroom floor along with the odd lantern ever burning illuminating it. You vault up to upper level and set about looking for the nearest member of wolverine security.";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     Like all cops, or rent-a-cops in this case, they are never around when you need them, so you decide to cut out the middleman and head for their office in the back of the mall. You push your way through the crowds of people till you reach the back of the mall and the coffee shop that the wolverines have set up in. Most of the assembled mutants pay you no heed as they appear too engrossed in their paperwork, or fleeting moments of downtime. However, the receptionist among them, likely noting the concerned look on your face, waves you over and asks what's wrong. Bounding over to them, you hurriedly explain to them the situation in the sewers. Frustratingly, the man shakes his furry head, informing you that his company is not responsible for what happens in the sewers. His people have enough on their plate worrying about what's going on in the mall and its adjacent area. Justifiably irate, you try telling them if situations were reversed wouldn't he want someone to help him, rules be damned?";
					say "     Your argument falls flat though as the man seems unmoved citing protocols, bylaws, and every tired corporate copout under the flipping sun. Eventually, your argument draws the attention of some of the locals who gather around to watch your tirade. Sensing an opportunity, you call upon your inner demagogue and begin directing your requests more to the crowd than the man alone as you verbally paint an ever more fanciful picture of the situation. Your oration stokes the long simmering fires of distrust and ambivalence many feel towards peace officers and authority in general. Many of the onlookers stories of past grievances with the wolverines (both real and imagined) flow freer than leaded wine and venereal disease at a Roman orgy. All the while, you subtly offer the man an out if he would simply humor the idea of sending a rescue party. Sensing the collective humans and post-human metamorphs growing ire at their continued inaction, the receptionist eventually yields.";

					say "     Throwing up his hands in defeat, he promises to speak with his boss and potentially assemble a volunteer search party as soon as she gets back into the office, as he claims that he doesn't have either the authority or the clout to do such things on his own. Satisfied for the moment at least, you tell him that that will have to do, then give him a description of the other survivor alongside her location; all of which the wolverine male jots down on a pad of paper that he stashes away for later.

				-- "Steal their bag and leave.":
					say "     Thinking about it, that bag of theirs looks pretty nice. So nice in fact that you can't see why someone as foolish as this should be allowed to keep it. If they're too weak to take care of themselves, it's only natural that a stronger, smarter, more able survivor like yourself should prey upon the weak and put their meager resources to proper use. Who is to say they wouldn't do the same to you if the table were turned? You muse, eyeing their meager possessions. 'Uh hey what's up, you, uh, figured out a way to get me out of here?' the helpless survivor asks in a nervous tittering tone. Chuckling at their weakness, you stride over to them, you kneel down then calmly scoop up their pack and throw it over your shoulder. 'Hey-hey-hey, what are you doing? That's my bag!' the failed survivor bleats as you casually adjust the straps to better fit your [BodyName of Player] body in front of them before turning on your heel and start walking at a lackadaisical pace back to the Mall, without sparing the pathetic failed survivor a second glance.";
					say "     For a moment, they simply stare dumbfounded at the back of your head as the gravity of their situations fully hits them. You can hear them begin to sob meekly followed by a string of cursing and pleading shouts for you to come back that become ever more unhinged by the second. With each bend you round, the sound of their voice grows more distant, and the focus of their cries shifts from you to the ferals. As they try to get their attention, likely as one last desperate attempt to get revenge on you. Sadly for them, the area is just as desolate as when you came through the first. Whether this is due luck on your part, or something about this odd stretch of sewers is anyone's guess. Either way, it doesn't matter to you as you spot the pale sickly yellow light streaming through the large crack in the roof of the sewers that leads to the Mall's bathroom floor.";

You're only left with a pair of sugary sports drinks with a black wolf head on the logo, some clean rolls of gauze bandages, a number of energy bars, and a beat up claw hammer for your trouble.

Sarea of Beach Reunion is "Beach".


to say ResolveEvent Beach_Reunion:
	say "     Wandering around the crowded-yet-calm pathways of the beach plaza, you're struck by the peaceful nature of the humans and post-humans gathered here. Sure, one or two of the infected and the occasional human get a little handsy from time to time, but all and all, the beach goers seem to be conducting themselves rather well. At least compared to what you've seen in the rest of the city, you muse, drifting through the tightly packed maze of towels and umbrellas littering the area. Nearing the northern cliff face bordering the state fair, your idle stroll is cut short as you hear a familiar feminine voice calling to you. 'Holy moly, [Name of Player], is that you?!' Searching around for the source, you spot a bare foot, heavily pregnant, bronze-skinned, bikini-clad monster woman peering over the shapely mound of her fecund tanned tummy and lush blue lycra-wrapped tits at you. As your eyes meet, you recognize that the golden orbs of the reclining figure belong to Galaxite, the woman you rescued from the sewers a while back resting front side up on a long white beach towel with a red cloth backpack set atop it like makeshift pillow by the entrance to the rocky cliffs.";
	say "     Seeing the light of recognition in your eyes, she waves you over enthusiastically. Shrugging, and a bit curious as to what she's doing here, you head on over to her. Meandering through the various beachgoers, you note she seems to be going a lot better than when you last saw her. Her skin is no longer pale and sickly looking, but has taken on a beautiful glowing bronze that highlights her sleek athletic curves and tight runner thighs. Her breasts meanwhile have gained a delightful bit of padding, most likely a result of her current pregnancy as her cute perky DDs balanced atop her taut tum look rather lovely as they strain against her tiny blue bikini top. Perhaps noticing the way you're looking at her curves, the gravid monster girl fixes you with a knowing grin as she arches her back slightly to better highlight her condition saying, 'Oh my gosh [Name of Player] it's so good to see you! I didn't know you came to the beach, here for the [italic type]view[roman type] I take it?' With an polite smile, you tell her something like, and ask her what she's doing out here.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Shouldn't she be spelunking in the sewers for her ghost station? 'Oh no-no-no,' she laughs, fanning her left hand before her as if to clear the air. 'I'm not going back down there ever again, with all the weird penis monsters, demons, and creepy crawlies, I don't see how anyone could be living down there.' So, she's out of the adventuring game, you ask. 'Nope, in fact, I'm getting ready for my next one right now.' Galaxite pulls herself into a cross-legged sitting position as she gently rests her burgeoning stomach on her lap. Really, what's she going after this time? 'Huh, not sure I should be telling you this, but-,' Galaxite teases, playfully tapping her chin. 'You did save my bacon, sssoooo here's the deal. Not long after the initial outbreak, these weird paramilitary groups showed up and started setting up shop all over the city. Of course, not all of their bases survived all that long, I think the only one left is the Zephyr branch office in the High Rise District. But after doing some digging, I found a few of them along with their equipment are still somewhat intact, but that's not why I'm here,' she says, bobbing her head towards the shore.";
	say "     'See, those bases needed tons of clean food, water, fuel, immunity boosters, not to mention raw materials to keep them running. Now as you can guess, getting that stuff into the city is really hard right now, so a lot of it never made it through. From what I hear, one of these supply convoys was coming by the sea. But, it ended up beaching itself on some rocks out past the break,' Galaxite says gesturing to the ocean, with a languid wave of her left hand. Really how did they manage that, you'd think there'd be charts or records showing where the safe shipping lanes are, you ask. 'You know, I thought the same, but,' she shrugs and reaches into a flap on the side of her pack and pulls out a paper notepad with a pen wedged into the spiral spine. Flipping through its pages, she continues, 'According to this big hunky tiger shark named Kai,' Galaxite rumbling the name in a low lusty draconic treble as she involuntarily crosses and uncrosses her legs, 'and several of the other surfers around here, the ocean floor got a little mixed after the capitol went boom, and Atlantis showed up,' she adds, setting her notepad down beside her.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Interesting, but what makes her think that anything of value survived, you reply. 'Because the local Sirens and Otters told me so silly, well,' she smirks, lips curling into a far-too-wide predatory grin, 'after I gave them a few of my old bras at least,' she says idly fidgeting with straps of her blue bikini top. 'But apparently the cargo was hermetically sealed, not sure why though. The only reason no one's looted it is because the local Pirate Sharks are fighting some Yuppie Mink in turf war over the salvage rights, and, ha-ha,' Galaxite chuckles into her hand. 'Sorry-sorry, I just realized how crazy that must sound.' Tittering, you tell her not to worry about it doesn't sound any weirder than the [one of]rumors of a invisible floating city populated by transplanar anthropomorphic blue gryphons hovering above the downtown[or]stories of a tribe of mpreg-obsessed orcs running breeding slave camps in the warehouse district[or]tales of den of gay werewolves out in the urban forest[or]scuttlebut regarding a giant bouncy castle populated by living latex monsters off the coast[or]Gossip related to a gang of kobolds running around town using their hyper balls as glorified hippity-hops[at random]. 'Heh, right point taken [Name of Player],' Galaxite giggles, in an amused little trill.";
	say "     'So ya, as I was saying, no one can get near the wreck, but... I've got a perfect plan to deal with them! Can you guess what it is? Galaxite asks, as she leans forward and rests her hand on the taut surface of her gravid middle. Eh, [one of]enlisting a diverse crew of talented ex-air men with nothing to lose to seize the boat by force[or]teaming up with a salvage ship crew led by an old sea captain whose estranged child went down with the ship and who will stop at nothing to retrieve their remains so that they can be properly laid to rest on land[or]convincing a team of veteran thieves that she blackmailed into reuniting for one last job that will leave them set for life to help slip past them[or]the power of friendship[at random]? you query. 'Nope, even better, DRAGONS!' she gushes in a haughty dominant tone as her golden eyes seems to sparkle at the mere mention of the species. 'Well, Feral Sea Dragons to be precise,' Galaxite says with a proud look on her face as she drums her fingers along the hemline of her heavily swollen bronze tummy. Wait, she was able to tame Feral Sea Dragons. How is she able to command them, they don't seem to be the most, well, talkative creatures, you ask, perplexed.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Oh, I didn't tame them silly. The wild ones are great lays and give like,' she hesitates a moment as she lightly rocks her head from side-to-side, 'I wanna say the third or fourth best hugs in the city, but they are way too simple for a job like this. However, these guys on the other hand,' Galaxite pants as she leans back to stare at her ripening form. 'After they've had a little drink of mommy's milk,' Galaxite purrs rubbing her chin against the supple mass of her chest, 'become very amenable, not to mention loyal. Why I've already got a small pod of eight handsome little sea dreggys keeping an eye on me out in the surf,' she says, waving towards an oddly-shaped blue-green wave sharking about the shore. 'Once my boys here,' she points to her tummy, 'are done cooking, we're gonna go grab a few supplies and head out,' she says with a dreamy look on her face. 'Say, [Name of Player] since you seem so interested would you like to join in? I can give you a cut of whatever we find?' Galaxite asks, in an eager expectant tone.";

I think we should grab a few gill fruits just in case we need to go underwater.' [if hasgills < 1]Gill fruits? What are those, you ask. 'Right how to explain, uh,' Galaxite says with a thoughtful expression on her face as she wraps her fingers along the sandy shore. 'I guess you could think of them as some sort of mutagenic item like blue gryphon milk or wyvern goop. But instead of turning you into some kind of lowly hybrid or a yucky wannabe dragon, they let you breathe underwater while leaving your current form intact.' Well that does sound useful, where can you find them, you ask[else if hasgills is 1]Wait Gill fruit, you've run into those before. However, you haven't seen another tree in a while.

From what I gathered,' Galaxite pauses, picking up her pad, she reclines, crossing one of her shapely legs over the other as she idly flexes her feet and reads through her notes. 'Every time someone tries to pick one, the tree drops all its fruit. Allegedly,' she says, her eyes briefly narrowing to fine umbral pinpricks, as taps her left pointer finger against the brown cardboard-esque backing for emphasis, 'anything that hits the ground, or water instantly rots then the tree either dies, or goes dormant like that,' she adds, loudly snapping her fingers for effect. 'Lucky for us, there is one tree growing out of an old beached trawler down the coast,' Galaxite says, nodding her head towards the Wild Fringes. Right so what's the catch, you ask doubting such a rare find would be left unexploited for long. 'Well,' she says, drawing out the word in lazy drawl as her ears flutter along the tips of her raven black hair, 'it's sort of guarded by some nutty old Fruit Bats who keep attacking anyone that gets close to the [bold type]Ruined Trawler[roman type].

Don't get me wrong, given enough time.

You can't help but remark internally at how right the peerless smoothness feels nestled in the palm of your hand and the beautiful glow of the divine trinket reflected in your eyes. To think that this mewling human kept this to herself, your altered-mind rages as hurriedly stow it away from prying eyes, lest some jealous manlet dare snatch it from you.

Nodding, you inform her that it will do, for now, though she should not assume such a pathetic tithe will buy your loyalty or submission. 'Oh, of course not mighty one!' She kowtows, with another deep quick bow. 'That tiny pebble is a gift barely befitting your growing majesty, though you may find it useful nonetheless,' she preens, eyeing your expectant middles with obvious delight. Enjoying the sight of her subservience and a just hair curious about what she means, you demand she explain further.";

'Though potent, it lacked both a focus and a vessel worthy of its gifts,' she says as the flicker of a jealous sneer flutters along the edge of her lips. 'Until now Kai Monah, you alone are worthy to bear this tiny sliver of its blessing,' she intones, motioning to your gravid body with a languid wave of her left hand. 'However, your current form is but a pale shadow of the true majesty you could achieve. Help me scale sister, and you could be greater than any chromatic dragon of Kyr, Kai, or Kol. Just picture it my thuri,' she coos, draping her arms along the flush core of your expectant form. The familiar pulse of otherworldly energy arcs from her fingertips as she nuzzles her face against the bountiful swell of your clutch-laden tum. 'You could be the mother and father god of untolds hoards of true wyrms, all of them at your beck and call.'";

Reh-ol reck da han kovve nuthi, in a dream tenor, your stomachs swells ever-so-slightly at her touch as the life growing within you resonates with the essence of change flowing through you as hard protective shells grow over their nascent beings. Strangely though, as you run your paws over their resplendent forms, you feel neither fear nor alarm at this development, only pride at thought of birthing majestic creatures.

'When the way is clear, you need only roar [italic type]Naxokaazthur, naal faal hen klov gein los hi bel[roman type], to call my children to your side,' she whispers, as the colors bleed and twist into one another in a vibrant whirlpool of many colors and none. You stare helplessly transfixed by the sight as a sense of weary peace coils about the liminal facets of your mind like the warm inviting waves of some primeval sea. 'Reen Han Na,' Galaxite intones in clear airy cadence as your eyes begin to grow heavy as your consciousness sinks its balmy shadowy depths, 'reh-ol reck da han kovve nuthi.'

In its place is a rush of maternal purpose and voracious energy as your body thrums with the lingering touch of the strange monster girl. Though she seems long gone, her lofty promise still echoes in your mind, as you feel a subtle slithering pressure tugging at the back of your psyche, urging you to seek out the Wild Fringes, to ascend with all haste. Yet, its call grows weaker with each passing moment as your more rational side begins to assert itself and cautions you against further dealings with Galaxite. Who knows what she has planned for you, perhaps it would be best to rid yourself of this form and move on. Still as you gaze appreciatively at your regal draconic figure, you find it hard to push aside her words so casually. If the glorious body is truly but a shadow of its full potential, then wouldn't you be a fool to spurn her gift so flippantly?";

Even the vaunted wyverns and sea dragons of this place would be forced to kneel before you and your brood's majesty, a coiling intrusive voice urges as your eyes drift to the supple curves of your egg-laden middle. You feel a wicked smirk growing on your thin reptile lips at the thought of whelping your own flight of draconic servants. Yes, you rumble under your breath, perhaps you humor the little ape for a spell, at least until you take what you need from her.

	say "     Following Galaxite's directions, you boldly set off towards the Wild Fringes, strewn with trash, driftwood, and jagged rocks. The area definitely lives up to its name. More than once, you have to stop yourself from accidentally stepping on some rusty algae-encrusted syringe or slipping on a tangle of horrid smelling sun-baked eelgrass. Under other circumstances, you might have been tempted to embrace your inner Susan and complain to the people in the coastal management program, if they even still exist. At least, you take some solace in the fact that the vile state of the area is probably keeping the locals away. Otherwise, you doubt that this alleged Gill Fruit Tree would still be left standing. Such a thing, if real, would no doubt make a fine prize in the world outside the city. You can easily see many countries and corporations clamoring over access to something that could give people the ability to breathe underwater without compromising their humanity."; [Author's Note: a Susan is what we used to a call a Karen here in 2008.]
	say "     Heck, you might even hang on to one, it could make a great nest egg for when you get older. Especially if you could cultivate it, why, you'd be set for life, you muse as you trek along the rough coastline. Though your path, if you could call it that, gets worse and worse as the place steadily devolves into a fetid rat's nest of sharp barnacle-encrusted sandstone mounds impeding your path and heavily-polluted urchin-infested tidepools clustered about the shore, forcing you to carefully wade through the off-smelling waters lest you stab your feet on their wicked-looking spikes, or trip on the moldering medical waste blighting them. You briefly consider trying to scale the nearby hills, but you're not too sure that you'd be able to get back down in a reasonable manner. As the farther you look south along the coast, the higher and craggier the rock face gets. Besides, Galaxite's directions were pretty clear [']keep going along the shore till you find it[']. How long could it really take, you wonder, cresting yet another flotsam ridden sand dune on your search.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     [bold type]An indeterminate amount of time later,[roman type] and you're starting to feel like you're on a freaking snipe hunt. Everything is starting to look the same and you're almost ready to turn around then give that over-bronzed bimbo a piece of your mind. All you've found these last few minutes are new and imaginative ways to get tetanus or lockjaw, but no boat, or tree, you muse, peering down the coast at a large pile of rubble about the size of a modest two house that's fallen over a huge section of the sandbar blocking your view downspin. Gazing at this latest impediment with a growing sense of aggravation, you decide that this will be the last stupid obstacle that you're going to climb. If that damn wreck is not on the other side, you are so done! You think to yourself as you slowly pick your wall of rock and driftwood. As you at last pull yourself over the edge of the loosely-packed debris, you let out a low pleased whistle as you're finally greeted by the sight of your search.";
	say "     Roughly wedged between a formation of pale wave-polished chert, the ruined trawler looks like it's been here for a very long time. Its timbers are almost completely bare and sun-bleached with only a few hints of white and black paint remaining along the dilapidated wheelhouse. Its keel, along with the lower deck, have mostly collapsed under the weight of the frame and the large gill fruit growing out the poop deck. Partially submerged by the waves, the massive piece of flora looming over the wreck reminds you of a mix of a Strangler Fig, Rainbow Eucalyptus, and Banyan tree, at least with the way kaleidoscopic roots have grown around the wheel house and taken much of the processing area. While the odd slitted fruits growing on its many branches, are a rather otherworldly sight. Offhandedly, a part of you wonders where it could have come from. Could it be a result of the nanites messing with the seeds of some long dormant species? A mutation of the Awesome Fruit Tree that somehow found its way to the shore?";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Or perhaps, it's something that got transported here in the gut of one of the fantastical creatures that have shown up after the nanites were released? Shrugging, you realize you may never know, and even if you did, it wouldn't change anything. You look around the rear of the wreck and spy the other item of your search, the still intact remains of the boat nets and lines lazily floating in the surf behind it. It shouldn't be too hard to reel those in, you opine, picking your way down the rubble. Only when your [BodyName of Player] feet hit the sand though, do you remember, a bit too late, Galaxite's warning about the place being home to some Fruit Bats. As a rustling din from what's left of the trawler's lower deck catches your attention, eight Fruit bats swarm out of the rents in the hull. They look at you in unison and screech bloody murder at your intrusion then take to the air.";
	say "     They circle, swoop, and pelt you with rocks like an angry flock of ravens trying to drive off a hawk till one drops low and lands in front of you, yelling, 'This tree belongs to the Zee Batz outsider! Leave now!' as it flaps its wings wildly before you in a base effort to look larger and more intimidating. Thinking on your feet, you wonder if you should take them up on their offer. Fruit bats aren't the toughest things out there, but there are alot them. Something also tells you they won't fight fair if you try to take them all on[if strength of Player > 25].

Under other circumstances, you might have been tempted to embrace your inner Susan and complain to the people in the coastal management program, if they even still exist. At least, you take some solace in the fact that the vile state of the area is probably keeping the locals away. Otherwise, you doubt that this alleged Gill Fruit Tree would still be left standing. Such a thing, if real, would no doubt make a fine prize in the world outside the city.

You briefly consider trying to scale the nearby hills, but you're not too sure that you'd be able to get back down in a reasonable manner. As the farther you look south along the coast, the higher and craggier the rock face gets. Besides, Galaxite's directions were pretty clear [']keep going along the shore till you find it['].

Gazing at this latest impediment with a growing sense of aggravation, you decide that this will be the last stupid obstacle that you're going to climb. If that damn wreck is not on the other side, you are so done! You think to yourself as you slowly pick your wall of rock and driftwood.

Its keel, along with the lower deck, have mostly collapsed under the weight of the frame and the large gill fruit growing out the poop deck. Partially submerged by the waves, the massive piece of flora looming over the wreck reminds you of a mix of a Strangler Fig, Rainbow Eucalyptus, and Banyan tree, at least with the way kaleidoscopic roots have grown around the wheel house and taken much of the processing area. While the odd slitted fruits growing on its many branches, are a rather otherworldly sight. Offhandedly, a part of you wonders where it could have come from.

You look around the rear of the wreck and spy the other item of your search, the still intact remains of the boat nets and lines lazily floating in the surf behind it. It shouldn't be too hard to reel those in, you opine, picking your way down the rubble. Only when your [BodyName of Player] feet hit the sand though, do you remember, a bit too late, Galaxite's warning about the place being home to some Fruit Bats.

Casting your abyssal gaze to The Beach Plaza, you can see the patch work of pale sickly yellow glow of artificial light filtering through the shuttered and boarded windows of the surrounding buildings as they huddle in fear of the benighted clouds and void-wrought frost like frightened shoals of fish. Some slithering section of your liminal mind can't help but chuckle at their mammalian fragility, as the blaring gale and heavy patter of viscous rain upon your thick, oily, scales is the gentle caress of a caring nocturnal lover.

Taking in the sight of the narrow flight of metal stairs, a part of you worries your draconic bulk might not be able to fit, yet with the aid of your body's natural lubrication and just a bit of careful maneuvering, you're just barely able to squeeze your way down. Along the way, your sharpened senses pick up an enticing medley of abyssal brine and... fish?

You ruminate as your paws finally reach the landing and you're relieved to find the corridor open up just enough for you to walk, though you still have to watch your horns as more than once your draconic horns scrape a number of overhead pipes. Carefully tilting your head upward, the molten golden glow of your many eyes pushes back the linger shadows cast by the ship's utility lines enough to see the poor state of the ship's internals. Here and there, you spy large paint bubbles forming along the walls, leaking foul smelling rust tainted liquid, or the occasional pipe oozing what you dearly hope is gray water as you prowl through the deck.

Huffing under your breath, you descend this next flight of stairs and pick your way deep into the bowels of the ship.

Seemingly taken aback, Tiamat stares at you with a look of pure bewilderment, but only for a moment as a look of profound sadness blooms on her face. '*Sigh* truly kin da mun, you would scorn my gifts over such trifling concerns?' Tiamat asks, tilting her head at a questioning angle. Trifling to her to maybe, but not you, you huff.";
			say "     'Then it seems my sweet Olivia was right about you all along little, a pity, you and her would have wondrous avatars for us, but alas if you will not serve the five heads then you leave me with few options little mouse,' she tuts, cocking back her left hand while spreading fingers wide then lunges towards you in a blinding blurr with her arm aimed at your throat. Caught off guard by her sudden burst of inhuman speed and the accompanying subsonic boom washing over your senses, you don't even have the time to even consider blocking or dodging her as she barrels into you and sinks her nails about your larynx. Stunned by both the sudden wall of overpressure nearly popping your eardrum and the strength of her superhuman grip, you can only stare at her in pure bewilderment as her hand seems to flow into your scales while your body goes limp. In that instance, the presence surges forward, smothering your awareness in a chittering and maddening tide of umbral coils while Tiamat slams her feet into your [breast size desc of player] chest, knocking the wind out you.";

Oddly though, you feel neither pain or pressure, but a profound sense of tearing course though your body at her sudden bestial attack. In seconds, the sensation intensifies and your vision cracks then distorts as Tiamat rebounds off your tauric body with your throat still clutched in her grasp. At once, primeval fear laced with unbound dread surges through you as she somersaults through the air, as she sails through the breeze, though you catch sight of your still intact tauric body, its golden eyes dimming by the second as it sways listless in the gale. Before you can give this impossible sight a moment's thought, Tiamat lands on the deck with a gentle swishing sound, then releases her hold on you, letting your body tumble to the floor in a rattled heap. Looking down at yourself, your eyes are greeted by the sight of your original body, though you still retain your prior size and ratios, you are once again for all intents and purposes, human.";
			say "     Chuckling at your confusion, Tiamat strides past you to stand beside the soulless husk of your former self crowing, 'Ah would that I could bottle the look on your face, did you think I was going to kill you?' as she turns on her heel to face you. Barely even able to nod as your every frayed nerve suddenly in agony as the biting cold of the and shock of your violent separation from your old body, you reply you weren't sure what she was going but so long as you're free of her, being turned back into human is a small price to pay. 'Well,' she pauses to languidly run her hand down the side of your former self, 'the thought had occurred to me, but in recognition of your service in returning my Olivia to me and the gracious donation of these wondrous nanite's here. I have decided to let you live,' Tiamat says with a haughty reptilian chuckle. Who, you question. 'Ah silly me, you never told them your real name, did you dear?' she says as her eyes drift over your shoulder. Following her gaze, you worriedly look behind only to have your eyes be met with a sudden burst of ghosty white light and a tittering jeer, 'BOO!' The blinding flash crows as you wince reflexively while blinking tears from your eyes.";

			say "     As your vision clears, the pale alabaster light coalesces and shifts into a second translucent grinning Tiamat floating on her stomach with her chin proppeed neatly in the palms of her hand while she playfully fans her legs behind herself. Utterly flabbergasted, you can only mutter a single question. Olivia? 'In the flesh, er,' she hesitates a moment to flex her left hand before her own ethereal face, 'ectoplasm I guess,' she says as she levitates past you to Tiamat's side. 'See T.,' she preens coming to a stop next to the alleged god-things left shoulder, 'I tried to warn you, they weren't up for this,' they add motioning to you with a dismissive wave of her right hand. 'Indeed, you did my [bold type]FAILED[roman type] avatar,' Tiamat grumbles, grinding her teeth in aggravation. 'Daw T., you're not mad at widdle old me are you?' Olivia simpers sweetly as she rolls onto her back and leisurely floats above you. 'No my dear,' Tiamat sighs wistfully, shaking her head, 'as ever you have been a faithful, if willful servant. Still, with no others to claim the mantles of Kai Monah and Hen Klovve, I fear I have no further use for this world,' she rumbles dejected.";
			say "     'A pity,' she tuts idly casting her gaze hither and thither, 'for all its flaws, I would have liked to preserve this place and its peoples from the coming doom, in my own way.' Coming doom what is she talking about, you question. 'Silly mouse, like many of your kind, you are truly blind to the world around you. Tell me, how long do you think the other gods or devils will sit quietly in their little corners content to play their own games? How long do you believe the horrors stalking your sphere will remain content in their current hunting grounds?' Tiamat lectures, motioning to the vague direction of the city with a casual flick of her ears. Confused by her words, you ask her to elaborate. '*Sigh*, foolish creature, perhaps your short-sighted kind deserve their fate so heed my words well little mouse!' She roars, pointing an accusatory finger at you.";

For I would have delivered your sphere from this doom, remade it into a realm of perfect order ruled over by you and my loyal Olivia forevermore! But no kin da mun!' she spits, stomping her left foot against the deck. 'You lack the ambition, faith, and stomach to make the hard choices necessary for salvation unlike,' she swoons, all the fire draining from her voice as she tilts her head upward to watch the reclining form of Olivia drift above her, 'you my child,' she adds beckoning Olivia to her side with a come-hither flick of her fingers. Nodding, the ghostly image of Olivia floats down and kneels before her fleshy counterpart, humming, 'Yes T.?' in a sweet honeyed tune. 'You alone have shown the spine and flexibility needed to survive and thrive in this sphere, for this I offer you the chance to continue service to me and take up the mantle of Kai Monah. So tell my child, what say you? Will you remain here to idle away what little time this world has left, or will you join me and become the dragon you always dreamed of being?'

Merely to have her tone darken seconds later as her translucent head drops her chest as she croaks, 'Damn it, I can't leave boys here T., they need their mommy, and I-I-I need them,' as she punches the deck in dismay though her strike produces no sound or impact. 'I did all this for them, so they could be free and we could be together forever like you promised!' she sobs, ghostly tears streaming down her face as she fixes her doppelganger with an imploring look. 'I have not forgotten my loyal dragon mother,' Tiamat coos, as she kneels beside the translucent woman wraps her arms around her ethereal head, 'they will be free to join us and recognition of service thus far, I shall altered the oath, no longer shall Naxokaazthur or Ullokinne be bound to my will. But yours instead,' she adds, patting the see-through woman's hair. 'Really T., you mean it?' Olivia asks, her tone brightening. 'Yes child, but I have but one stipulation,' she says, her hands drift down along Olivia's supple hourglass curves as she gently fondles her svelte middle.";

While your nights will be filled with the ecstasy of birth and the eternal attention of scores of supplicants waiting on your every need. Now I ask you again, will you serve as the five heads commands and take your place at my side, or throw your lot in with a doomed species?' Tiamat intones, as she rises to her full height to await Olivia's reply. 'Mh, that's a tough choice T.,' Olive chuckles through an amused Cheshire smile, 'either get stuck on this rock waiting to die with the rest of the dumb monkeys, or spend the rest of my days playing with every flavor of dragon in the multiverse with my boys,' she rumbles, pawing at her toned tummy.";
			say "     'Indeed, so what say you Olivia or should I say, Kai Monah?' Tiamat simpers expectantly. Bobbing her head, Olivia touches her forehead to the deck in deep reverent kowtow, whispering, 'Zu'un aam ol faal hen klovve.' 'Well spoken Kai Monah, now go claim your mantle while I deal with the kin da mun,' Tiamat says, whipping her left arm toward the churning storm lashed sea. A sudden ripple passes through your old tainted shell, as the soulless body jerks to and awkwardly prowls over the side of the yacht. Seemingly blind and lacking any manner of awareness, your unwanted body hits the railing with heavy thump, yet still keeps prodding till this timbers break and it goes plummeting to the ocean below while the ship, still carried by the waves, sails on without it. Yelping in alarm, Olivia swiftly dives in after it while Tiamat redirects her attention to you. 'As for you little mouse, begone I have no further use for you or this damned world, but feel free to stay and watch the show, or crawl under a rock like the rats your kind descends from! I CARE NOT WHICH!!' she hisses with a snap of her fingers before you can utter a single word in reply as the world goes dark and reality melts away into a gray fog.";
